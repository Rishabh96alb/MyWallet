My Wallet Balance application is created using ContextAPI where I have provided IncomeSources, Expenses and Balance in the main file and these variables are being consumed in MyWallet.jsx using useContext hook which is used for using the variables wrapped inside Context.Provider.
I have done all CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in my application to create, show, edit and delete all the inputs which are being added dynamically.

Tech stack used: React, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Github
Tools used: VS Code

Screenshots of my application are below for reference :
